# The Venue - Car Events

### The Venue is a modern event landing page for future events. <br>

**Features:**
* Animated ticket subscription prices with a discount!
* Animated location & time for the event!
* A map so you can see the event location!
* A countdown timer to keep track of how many days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the event! 

## Getting Started ⌨

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.<br>
See the **Deployment** section on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites ✏

Make sure you have the following installed on your system before preceding.
* Node & NPM

## Installation 💿

These are a series of step by step examples that will help you get a development environment up & running.

### Step 1. Download the zip or clone the repo 💾

```
git clone https://github.com/LijahTheDev/The-Venue.git
```

### Step 2. Install Dependencies 🗂

Once you have the project folder ready to go, open the folder in your favorite code editor.<br>
Once you have opened the project folder in your code editor,<br> 
open the project directory in a terminal and run the following command in the project folder/directory.

```
npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies and get all the required packages for this project.

### Step 3. Run Project on Local Dev Server 💻

Next, you'll want to run a local development server with live reloading.<br> 
When you make changes and save, the server running the project on localhost will automatically reload.<br>
Create-React-App makes it easy to spin up a local server on localhost by typing an easy command in the terminal.

```
npm run start
```
or 
```
npm start
````

## Deployment 📢
After following the previous installation steps up above,<br> 
you can run the following command to have an optimized production version of the project where you can put the project on a host of your choice.
```
npm run build
```
This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
**The Venue is ready to be deployed!**

See React's section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### How I Handled Deployment 🔌

I used **Netlify** for deployment. It was one of the easiest things I did on this project.<br> 
I linked this repo to Netlify so anytime I push my changes to this repo it will automatically update the live website!<br>

## Acknowledgments 💡

I built this project while taking ["The React practice course, learn by building projects."](https://www.udemy.com/the-react-practice-course-learn-by-building-projects/) course.<br> 
This is where the project idea, structure, and knowledge came from.<br> 
I made some customizations and tweaks such as making it more mobile friendly.<br> 
I'm thankful for this course, it taught me a lot and The Venue was my first react landing page!❤😎
